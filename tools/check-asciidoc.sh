# git-hooks.nix ships no AsciiDoc linter, and the render pipeline is the only
# thing that reads these files -- so without this, a broken include or an
# unterminated block is first noticed by the CI render matrix, several minutes
# and five parallel jobs later. asciidoctor parses in well under a second per
# document, so the same class of mistake can be caught at commit time.
#
# Every document is checked once per language. The bodies are five
# `ifeval::["{lang}" == "<lang>"]` blocks, so a conditional left unterminated in
# the Romansh block is simply invisible while parsing as English, which is what
# a single default-language pass would do.
#
# Runs from the repository root. Both checks below resolve paths from there, and
# it is where prek invokes this in the hook and in CI.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Parse, convert, and fail on anything asciidoctor diagnoses at INFO or above.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `--out-file -` with stdout thrown away, not `--out-file /dev/null`: asciidoctor
# special-cases that one path and returns the loaded document *without ever
# converting it* -- lib/asciidoctor/convert.rb reads
#
#     when '/dev/null' then return load input, options
#
# so nothing the converter diagnoses could reach this gate at any
# --failure-level. An unresolved <<xref>> is diagnosed during conversion, which
# is why this used to be documented as out of reach: the symptom was real, the
# explanation was not. Converting for real and discarding the HTML costs nothing
# measurable (2.5s either way across the whole repository), because the parse is
# the expensive half.
#
# `--failure-level=INFO` and `--verbose` are then both needed, for different
# reasons: an unresolved cross-reference is logged at INFO, so INFO has to be
# fatal *and* has to be logged at all. asciidoctor has no --log-level; -v /
# --verbose is its only lever on the logger, and it lowers the threshold to
# DEBUG. WARN stays fatal as before -- asciidoctor otherwise prints
# "unterminated listing block" and still exits 0.
#
# Lowering the threshold to DEBUG also turns on 35 lines per language that
# open-govpress's own extensions provoke ("unknown style for literal block:
# mermaid", "unknown name for block macro: field", ditto "signature"): plain
# asciidoctor has no such extensions, so it says so, once per block. Those are
# filtered out rather than explained away in this comment, because DEBUG sits
# below INFO and can therefore never change the exit code -- the lines are noise
# by construction, and 175 of them per run would train people to stop reading
# this gate's output. The filter keys on the level label, not on the three
# messages, so a fourth open-govpress extension needs no change here and nothing
# that could ever fail the gate is hidden.
#
# One asciidoctor per language rather than per file-and-language: Ruby startup
# dominates (0.29s per invocation, whatever the document's size), so batching the
# whole repository costs 2.5s where 100 separate runs cost 29s. The price is
# paid by exactly one message: the INFO line for an unresolved cross-reference
# reads "possible invalid reference: <key>" and names no file and no line, so a
# batched failure says which reference dangles but not where. That is worth 26
# seconds a commit, because the key is its own locator -- `git grep -n '<<key'`
# lands on it -- while WARN and ERROR, which is nearly everything else, do name
# their file and line.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every cited reference key has a reference entry defining it.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The check above cannot do this and no log level makes it: a citation is the
# literal text `[St2024]`, and a reference entry is a description-list term
# `[St2024]::` (or, once the lists are centralised, a bibliography anchor
# `[[[St2024]]]`). Nothing connects the two, so a citation whose entry was never
# written -- or, now that the lists are moving into tagged partials, whose entry
# a `tags=` selector did not select -- renders as a bracketed label pointing at
# nothing, in silence, in asciidoctor and in open-govpress alike.
#
# asciidoctor-reducer resolves the includes and the `ifeval::` guards and prints
# the flattened source, which is the only honest way to ask what a given language
# actually ends up containing: it applies the same tag selection that will
# silently drop an entry, so a mis-tagged include shows up here as the citation
# losing its definition. It ships with the asciidoctor package devenv.nix
# already pulls in.
#
# Always the whole tracked corpus, whatever arguments were passed, because a
# citation and its entry live in different documents: only Em002 and Em002-7
# carry reference lists, and every other document says so in prose ("The
# references ... can be found in the Em002 Strategic Guidelines"). Checking a
# document against its own entries alone would report every citation in Em002-1.
# The flip side is that this cannot catch an entry that went missing from one
# list while another list still defines the key.
