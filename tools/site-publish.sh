#
# GitHub Pages deployments are whole-site snapshots: `actions/deploy-pages`
# replaces everything each time and offers no way to read back what is already
# published. Keeping older builds around therefore needs somewhere to remember
# them between runs, and that somewhere is the `site-history` branch -- cloned
# here, overlaid with the build that was just rendered, and pushed back. The
# caller then uploads the whole of <work-dir> as the Pages artifact, so the
# deployment stays a snapshot while its *contents* accumulate.
#
# Where the build lands depends on the ref:
#
#   refs/tags/<tag>   -> tags/<tag>/       kept forever, root untouched
#   refs/heads/main   -> commits/<short>/  pruned to $KEEP_COMMITS, and the root
#
# The root keeps meaning "current head of main", which is what the site has
# always meant. A tag archives itself without disturbing it.
#
# Environment:
#   GITHUB_REPOSITORY  owner/repo, used to build the push URL
#   GITHUB_REF_TYPE    `branch` or `tag`
#   GITHUB_REF_NAME    branch or tag name
#   GITHUB_SHA         commit being published
#   GITHUB_RUN_ID      recorded in build-meta.txt, for tracing a build back
#   GH_TOKEN           token with contents:write
#   KEEP_COMMITS       how many main builds to retain (default 10)
#   SITE_REMOTE        override the push URL (tests point this at a bare repo)
#   SITE_BRANCH        override the accumulator branch (default site-history)
#
# Never run this under `set -x`: the push URL carries the token.
