  # open-govpress (https://gitlab.com/swiss-armed-forces/cyber-command/cea/open-govpress)
  # is the CLI used to render these .adoc documents to PDF. It ships as a
  # generic dynamically-linked Linux binary (electron-builder's tar.gz
  # target), which cannot execute directly on NixOS -- there is no
  # /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 and no FHS layout for it to find its shared
  # libraries in. Wrapping it in an FHS environment (the same trick nixpkgs
  # itself uses for Chrome/Electron/AppImage binaries) lets the unmodified
  # upstream tarball run as-is, with no patchelf/rebuild step.
  #
  # The build is fetched from a GitHub Release rather than committed to the
  # repo: at ~112MiB it clears GitHub's 100MB hard limit on regular git
  # objects, and this repo is a fork, which GitHub's LFS policy blocks from
  # uploading *new* LFS objects at all -- release assets hit neither limit.
